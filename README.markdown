DHCPv6 Client
=============

Description
-----------
Android doesn't support DHCPv6 out of the box, because Google doesn't want to implement this feature. For some people (especially universities and corporations) this is a serious issue, because they require control over their IPv6 addresses.

This app fixes this issue. It requests an IPv6 address using DHCPv6 and makes your Android future-proof.

For a full explanation on how this app works please refer to the xda-developer thread
